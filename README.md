# dnd-monster-hunter
An implementation of [Amellwind's Guide to Monster Hunting](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LCk9FgQaqaXBVmLeCeT) for [Aurora Builder](https://aurorabuilder.com).

## Installation
First, install [AuroraLegacy](https://github.com/AuroraLegacy/elements), as these files were built with at least the `core` & `supplements` from AuroraLegacy as a prerequisite.

Next, add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotTheTom/dnd-monster-hunter/main/amellwinds-guide-to-monster-hunting.index` as an index file in Aurora, have it download the content for you, and restart the app. You should be good to go!

## Using the Content
There a few differences and complications when using this content with Aurora.

### Backgrounds
The backgrounds found within Amellwind's Guide to Monster Hunting grant additional features for being a member of the associated faction. 

Whilst these additional features are present within the background's description, the additional Guild Feature must be manually added to your character sheet. 

Also the additional spells granted from these backgrounds will only appear in spell lists that you must choose your available spells from, such as Wizard or Sorcerer, and will not appear in spell lists you only have to prepare from, such as Druid.

### Elder Dragonborn
Whilst Amellwind's Guide to Monster Hunting describes Elder Dragonborn as variants of the base Dragonborn race, they have been implemented as a seperate race and split into subraces for convenience.

### Equipment
It is recommended you have item cards enabled to be able to easily see all the abilities these new items grant.

The armor changes in Amellwind's Guide to Monster Hunting have been added as seperate items in the Magic Armor category on the Items page. 

The stat boosts that later upgrade levels of armor grant are present in the Additional Bonuses category of the items page. 

Whilst they will still alter the character sheet appropriately they will not be present in the inventory on the character. 

It is reccomened you alter the description of your armor to keep track of which bonuses you selected.

The common tier of weapons have been added to the normal Weapon category and all subsequent upgrade tiers are present in the Magic Weapons category on the Items page.

A variant of the Hunting Horn has been created that does not have any Notes if your DM chose to use the variant rule. 

In this situation the Notes have been added as seperate items that you can add to your inventory if the player wishes or they can be added to the items description.

The ammunition for ranged weapons has been added in their own categories for each weapon that requires them. The Bow just uses the normal arrows found in the Player's Handbook.

Due to trinkets being unique to each character they are implemented as just a base unstackable item that can be renamed or edited if the player chooses to.

You are required to attune to your currently equipped weapon, armor and both trinkets as per the rules in Amellwind's Guide to Monster Hunting. 

You can however ignore the attunement limit present as having all four attuned at once will pass said limit.
