            <p>Expanding the knowledge of your research is an important aspect of your job at the Royal Scriveners. When you discover new information about a creature related to your speciality, you can bring that information to a Royal Paleontology Sriveners owned location to recieve a stipend. Discuss with your DM what that amount is and if you can make more depending on what you discover or as you level up.</p>
