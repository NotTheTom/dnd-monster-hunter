            <p>Your guild will provide you with food and accommodation if necessary. You have access to a guild hall if one is present (located in most cities, towns, and villages).

Connections made through the guild for personal reasons may require a donation to the guild coffers. The guild requires dues of 5gp a month or at least one completed hunt per month.</p>
