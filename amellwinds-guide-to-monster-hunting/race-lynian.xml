        <description>
            <p>Lynians are sapient creatures, that are typically short of stature. There are currently three distinct groups of Lynian: the cat-like Felyne and Melynx, the lynx-like Grimalkyne and Boaboa, and the humanoid Shakalaka and Gajalaka, and the unique Uruki. The feline species are intelligent, have complex societies, and speak their own languages. Whereas the Shakalaka and Gajalaka are more primitive and tribal. The feline species tend to lead peaceful lives and often coexist with human society.</p>
            <p class="indent">Many lynians are seen working in all sorts of human establishments or settlements. They've been seen being farmers, traders, adventurers, etc. Some lynians are known to assist hunters, and quite a few are independent "Meownster Hunters" in their own right.</p>

            <p>Gajalaka are short humanoids. They resemble Shakalaka more than Felynes or Grimalkynes, lacking any fur and wearing large tribal masks which leave only their bright yellow eyes visible. These red masks have different color accents, ranging from blue to yellow to purple, to represent what status ailment their weapons afflict. The Gajalaka in the Caverns of El Dorado have golden masks.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Gajalaka are proud and barbaric, and are not strongly inclined toward good. They are slow to trust, but once someone gains the trust of a gajalaka, they are considered an ally for life, or until proven otherwise.</p>
