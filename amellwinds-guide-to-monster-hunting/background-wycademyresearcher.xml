            <p>Expanding the knowledge of your research is an important aspect of your job at the Wycademy. When you discover new information about a creature or resource related to your research, you can bring that information to a Wycademy owned location to receive a stipend. Discuss with your DM what that amount is and if you can make more depending on what you discover or as you level up.</p>
