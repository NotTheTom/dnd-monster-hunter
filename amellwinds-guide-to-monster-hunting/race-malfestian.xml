        <description>
            <p>Malfestians are covered in a mesmerizing mix of shimmering blue, green, and violet feathers. They have sharp, piercing eyes and beak-like mouths. Their wing-like arms end in taloned hands, and their strong, muscular legs end in clawed feet for gripping surfaces. Malfestians move with an eerie silence, making them skilled hunters and elusive prey. Known for their keen intelligence and stealth, they often use their feathers' vibrant colors to blend into their surroundings or create dazzling displays to confuse predators and prey alike.</p>
            <h4>Malfestian Traits</h4>
            <p>As a Malfestian, you have the following racial traits.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Age.</i></b> Malfestians typically achieve adulthood and earn an adult designation around the age of 18, yet they can live up to 250 years, allowing ample time to accrue wisdom and expertise over their long lifespans.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Malfestians might lean towards alignments that prioritize personal goals and intelligence-driven decision- making. Lawful Neutral or Neutral Evil could be common alignments.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Size.</i></b> Malfestians typically range in height from 4 to 5 feet tall, their physique resembles that of an owl, with slender frames, feathers in various hues, and distinctive facial features that include large eyes adapted for night vision. Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Flight.</i></b> You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Malfestio Genetics.</i></b> When you reach 3rd level, choose one of the genetic options below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b><i>Nightcloak.</i></b> You can cast the invisibility spell with this trait. When you use this version of Invisibility, you leave no physical evidence of your passage, so you can be tracked only by magic. You must finish a long rest to cast this spell again with this trait.</li>
                <li><b><i>Sonic Waves.</i></b> You can cast the confusion spell with this trait. When you use this version of Confusion, you can target one creature within range instead of an area.

            </ul>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Wings.</i></b> Your wings are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Common.</p>
