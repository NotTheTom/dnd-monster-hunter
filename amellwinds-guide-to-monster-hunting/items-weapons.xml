            <p>This weapon has 5 slots that you can insert materials into.</p>
            <br />
            <p><b>Arcane Interference.</b> Due to the magical nature of this weapon, a creature cannot wield a shield while attuned to this weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Focus.</b> This weapon acts as a spell focus for your spellcasting.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Spell Storing.</b> This staff stores Spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The staff can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time.</p>
            <p class="indent">Only the wielder can Cast a Spell of 1st level into the staff by touching the staff as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the staff. If the staff can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p>
            <p class="indent">While wielding this staff, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell Attack bonus, and Spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the staff is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Defense.</b> Holding this staff grants a +3 bonus to your armor class.</p>

            <p>This weapon has 5 slots that you can insert materials into.</p>
            <br />
            <p><i>You gain a +3 bonus on attacks and damage rolls.</i></p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Empowered Strikes.</b> If your Unarmed Strikes deal at least 1d4 damage or more, this weapon deals that damage + 2 instead.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Wiredash.</b> Harnessing your expertise with wirebugs, you've honed the skill to swiftly evade harm. As a reaction when taking damage or when you succeed on a saving throw to resist an effect that would inflict a status condition, you can move up to 20 feet in any direction of your choice. During this movement, you ignore difficult terrain and don't provoke opportunity attacks. You can use this property a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Wirefall.</b> While you are falling, you can use your reaction to throw your wirebug above you, stopping your descent in mid-air until the start of your next turn. When you begin your fall again, the height you stopped at is the new value used for the amount of fall damage you take. You also can expend two uses of wirefall to cast the feather fall spell. You can use this property a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Silkbind.</b> Immediately after you hit a creature during your attack action, you can use your bonus action to slam your fist against the ground, planting a wire into the earth that wraps around the creature, binding it within a 10-foot radius from the wire's point of placement. The creature can't move beyond this radius until the wire is snapped.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the start of the bound creature's turn, it can attempt to break free by succeeding on a Strength saving throw against a DC of 10 + your proficiency modifier + your choice of either your Strength or Dexterity modifier. Additionally, if the creature is at least one size category larger than you, you can attempt to grapple it while it's bound in this way, regardless of the size difference. It remains grappled by you even after it breaks free of the silkbind.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once the creature breaks free, it is immune to your Silkbind weapon property for 1 hour. You can use this property a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Wyvern Ride (1/Short Rest).</b> You can attempt to influence the actions of a creature on its turn, provided the creature is at least one size category larger than you and you are grappling it. As an action, make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check with advantage contested by the grappled creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). On a success, the silkbind breaks, and you can choose one of the following effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Forced Movement.</i> On its turn, the creature moves up to its speed in any direction of your choice, triggering opportunity attacks as normal. The movement must be within the creature's capability, such as flying if it possesses wings.</li>
                <li><i>Directed Attack.</i> On its turn, you compel the creature to make two weapon attacks (as part of its multiattack if it has one) against a target you select within its attack range.</li>
                <li><i>Ramming Maneuver.</i> On its turn, the creature uses its movement to crash into a nearby solid object (such as a wall or tree) of your choice. The creature takes 1d10 damage for every 10 feet it moved (damage type determined by the object).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">Once the effect ends, if you beat the grappled creature by 5 or more the grapple doesn't end and you don't fall prone, otherwise the grapple ends and both you and the creature fall prone. Once used, you can't use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

            <p><i>You gain a +1 bonus on attacks and damage rolls.</i></p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Coating.</b> As a bonus action, you can coat up to 10 arrows in a special oil to add an effect to your arrows. The oil lasts for 10 minutes before evaporating. If the coating causes an effect that requires a saving throw the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent">Characters are not supposed to have an infinite amount of coatings or ammunition available to them, they should be bought at a price that the GM sees fit.</p>
            <p class="indent">A flask of coating weighs the same as a flask of oil by default, and a holster of ammunition weighs the same as a bag of ball bearings.</p>
            <p class="indent">The GM should determine how much coating or ammunition of each type a character has. Generally speaking a character should not have more than a dozen flasks of a coating, or holsters of ammunition.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><i>Blast Coating.</i> An arrow with this coating damage type changes from piercing to fire. When you hit a target with this arrow, each creature in a 5-foot radius of the target takes half as much damage as the target as fire damage.</li>

The creature can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a successful save. A creature that succeeds on a save against this coating is immune to its effect for 24 hours.</li>
                <li><i>Poison Coating.</i> A creature struck by this arrow must succeed a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of your next turn.</li>

                <li><i>Power Coating +2.</i> You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls.</li>
                <li><i>Sleep Coating.</i> A creature struck by this coating must succeed a Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of your next turn. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more, it instead falls unconscious for 1 minute, until the creature takes damage, or is shaken awake as an action. A creature that succeeds a save against this coating or wakes up after suffering from its effects is immune to its effect for 24 hours.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent"><b>Dragonpiercer.</b> When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks to fire a dragonpiercer, striking all creatures in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw equal to your Coating save DC, taking 3d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If a creature is Huge or larger, it takes double damage. One you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
