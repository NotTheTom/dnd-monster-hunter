        <description>
            <p>Flying Neopteroids are distinguished by their translucent, iridescent wings that shimmer in the light. Their wings beat rapidly, producing a distinctive buzzing sound as they zip through the air. Known for their speed and grace, Flying Neopteroids deftly evade predators and obstacles alike, often using their natural agility to escape danger. They are highly valued by the Hunter's Guild for their ability to quickly traverse large distances, making them excellent couriers and lookouts.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Flight.</i></b> Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Flyby.</i></b> You don't provoke opportunity attacks when you fly out of an enemy's reach. You can use this trait only if your flying speed is greater than 0. You can use it a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Stinger.</i></b> Your stinger is a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal poison damage equal to 1d6 + your Constitution modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
