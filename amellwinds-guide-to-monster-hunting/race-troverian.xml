        <description>
            <p>Troverians are an industrious dwarf-like people who coexist with the dwarves in the village of Harth. Troverians are known to prefer living in underground areas, due to them using the many ores and minerals in the areas to produce equipment such as armour and weapons. Some troverian tribes have special ways to polish old equipment found in the field by hunters. This race is said to be "workaholics" due to them working for long periods. It's been said they can continue work day and night to produce such equipment without a need to sleep until their work is finished. Many of the troverian's clothes allow them to continue working without much problem, while also acting as their usual attire.</p>
            <h4>Trovierian Traits</h4>
            <p>Troverians resemble short, slightly stockier, and bulkier humans and are commonly mistaken for dwarves. Their skin usually tanned, Troverian males grow massive beards and moustaches, wearing them in odd but traditional shapes. Female Troverians lack facial hair all together, resembling human females with a smaller but sturdier frame.</p>
